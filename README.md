# data-driven-cpp
C++ implementation of example codes from the book: 

Data Driven Science & Engineering: Machine Learning, Dynamical Systems, and Control 
by S. L. Brunton and J. N. Kutz

I am going to use eigen3 (for Linear Algebra), opencv (for image loading, etc.), and matplotlib-cpp (for plots) library.
This is soley for studying purpose.
